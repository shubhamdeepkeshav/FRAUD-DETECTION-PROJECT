# Fraud Detection Project 🕵️
This project focuses on using machine learning algorithms to detect fraud in financial transactions.
# Overview  📋
 The repository contains code for training and evaluating different models to detect fraudulent activities in transaction data. It aims to provide accurate fraud detection capabilities using supervised learning techniques.
# Features 🛠️
    •	Data Preprocessing🛠️: Cleaning, transforming, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
    
    •	Model Training📚: Training classifiers including Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors.
    
    •	Model Evaluation📊: Assessing model performance using accuracy score, ROC curve, Precision-Recall curve, and confusion matrix.
    
    •	Visualization 📊: Visualizing model comparisons, feature importance, and evaluation metrics using matplotlib and seaborn.
    
    •	Deployment🚀: Options for deploying trained models in production environments for real-time fraud detection.
